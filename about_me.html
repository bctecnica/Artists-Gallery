        <h1 id="speakers" class="display-4 text-center my-5 text-muted">Portraiture</h1>
        <p>This self portrait was painted in couple of afternoons with a lamp to my right and natural light to my left. The combination of the two light sources 
provided some interesting contrasts across the face. It was painted, like the majority of my work, with acrylics on the smooth side of a sheet of hardboard prepared 
with several coats of white acrylic undercoat. My children have been somewhat critical of the result, commenting that I have made myself appear too 'grumpy' quite unlike my normal cheerful demeanour!</p>

        <h1 id="speakers" class="display-4 text-center my-5 text-muted">Landscape</h1>
        <p>The scene is of a weir on the River Creuse in the Limousin region of central France. I was struck by the contrast between the still, reflecting water on the left and the turbulent activity on the right. 
The curve the weir leads the eye to the old mill in the distance. It was painting with acrylics on canvas that is for me an unusual painting surface. My preference being for the smooth side of hardboard with its
absence of any texture. This painting has been sold.</p>


        <h1 id="speakers" class="display-4 text-center my-5 text-muted">Still life</h1>
        <p> This arrangement of objects was set up for me by one of my students who wanted to see my approach to painting a still life subject. 
I'm not sure if she realised how 'busy' a grouping she was presenting. It was certainly the most complicated I had attempted but nothing daunted, I decided to have a go. On completion I was quite pleased 
with the result and my student was suitably impressed. Subsequently it was also admired by the art editor of Artist and Illustrators magazine. She used a reproduction of it as an example of my work in a 
autobiographical article I had been asked to write for the magazine. </p>

        <h1 id="speakers" class="display-4 text-center my-5 text-muted">Nude</h1>
        <p> This painting was completed in about one and a half hours. I had been attending an all day session, painting from the nude, run by fellow artist Sara Parsons. Having worked for most of the day 
on an unsatisfactory piece I was left with only 90 minutes before the end of the pose and the session. I had only a large piece of board left on which to work and no drawing materials. Nonetheless I decided
to attempt to complete a painting in the time left and set rapidly to work. The resultant painting is so lively and full of energy that it has become one of my favourites.</p>

        <h1 id="speakers" class="display-4 text-center my-5 text-muted">Misc</h1>
        <p>This is an example of work that didn't fit into any of the categories above. This study of a display of lilies was painted on a canvas given to me. It had previously been painted as a very loose 
abstract with a small amount of texture in the paint. This I scraped off and initially, had intended to cover the surface during the painting of the lilies. However, as I worked I realised that the green 
echoed the colour of the leaves seen through the glass of the vase and the brown provided a little warmth into what otherwise might have been too cool a painting. I hope you will agree with me that I made the right decision.</p>
