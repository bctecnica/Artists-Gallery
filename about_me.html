                    <p>This self portrait was painted in couple of afternoons with a lamp to my right and natural light to my left.<br><br>The combination of the two light sources provided some interesting contrasts across the face. <br>  <br> It was painted, like the majority of my work, with acrylics on the smooth side of a sheet of hardboard prepared with several coats of white acrylic undercoat.<br><br>
                        My children have been somewhat critical of the result, commenting that I have made myself appear too 'grumpy' quite unlike my normal cheerful demeanour!<br></p>

                    <p> This arrangement of objects was set up for me by one of my students who wanted to see my approach to painting a still life subject. <br><br>I'm not sure if she realised how 'busy' a grouping she was presenting. It was certainly the most complicated I had attempted but nothing daunted, I decided to have a go. <br><br> On completion I was quite pleased with the result and my student was suitably impressed. <br><br>Subsequently it was also admired by the art editor of Artist and Illustrators magazine. <br><br>She used a reproduction of it as an example of my work in a autobiographical article I had been asked to write for the magazine.</p>

                    <p>This painting was completed in about one and a half hours. I had been attending an all day session, painting from the nude, run by fellow artist Sara Parsons. <br><br>Having worked for most of the day on an unsatisfactory piece I was left with only 90 minutes before the end of the pose and the session.<br><br> I had only a large piece of board left on which to work and no drawing materials. Nonetheless I decided to attempt to complete a painting in the time left and set rapidly to work. <br><br> The resultant painting is so lively and full of energy that it has become one of my favourites.</p>
